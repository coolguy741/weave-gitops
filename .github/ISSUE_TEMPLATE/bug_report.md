**What is the severity of the bug**
<!--
Please select a label for this ticket indicating the severity of this bug.

-->

- [ ] `severity/Critical`: Weave GitOps is crashing, the UI is inaccessible or a key feature is unusable. There is no known workaround.
- [ ] `severity/Major`: Weave Gitops functionality or a key feature is broken. There is a workaround, but the workaround requires significant effort.
- [ ] `severity/Minor`: A non-key feature or functionality is broken. There is a fairly straightforward workaround.
- [ ] `severity/Low`: Doesnâ€™t affect primary flow/functionality but would be good to fix.
