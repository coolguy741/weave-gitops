# WIP: Internal contributing guide

## Weave Gitops :heart:s your contributions

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Weave Gitops!

This guide **is a work in progress** but aims to cover all aspects of how to
interact with the project and how to get involved in development as smoothly as possible.

If we have missed anything you think should be included, or if anything is not
clear, we also accept contributions to this contribution doc :smile:.


## Building the binaries
To build the `gitops` binary locally you can run `make gitops`. This will create a `gitops`
binary in the `bin/` directory. Similarly running `make gitops-server` will create a
`gitops-server` binary in the same directory.


## Testing
We have 3 layers of testing:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Acceptance testing

We aim to follow the [testing pyramids best practises](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)
with the focus on a large number of units tests, fewer integration tests and even fewer acceptance tests.


### Running unit tests
You can run `make unit-tests` from the top of the repository to run all of the unit tests.
As part of running the unit tests we will install any required dependencies for building
the code. See [dependencies](tools/dependencies.toml) for more information on what's installed.


### Running integration tests
The integration tests can be run using `make integration-tests`. They require some
extra environment variables to run:

- `GITHUB_ORG`- The name of the org that test repositories can be created in.
If you're a Weaveworks employee you can use `weaveworks-gitops-test`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`- Used to create, push and delete repositories. Please ensure
the token has sufficient permissions, as deleting repositories is not part
of the standard set of permissions a token is given.

If you wish to run the full suite, you will also need the equivalent for gitlab:
- `GITLAB_TOKEN`
- `GITLAB_ORG`

However if you only want to test it against one of the providers, use [ginkgos focus](
https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs) feature to run the tests for one provider.
Example:
```
cat test/integration/server/add_test.go
...
 FContext("GitHub", func() {
```

### Running acceptance tests
The acceptance tests can be run using `make acceptance-tests`. They require the same
environment variables as the integration tests, with the following in addition:

- `WEGO_BIN_PATH`- The path to the `gitops` binary the tests should use. To test a locally
built binary which is created from `make gitops`, you want to set it to `WEGO_BIN_PATH=$PWD/bin/gitops`.
- `IS_TEST_ENV`- If this environment variable is set to anything, it indicates to the `gitops` binary
that it should deploy images using the `latest` tag, instead of the latest version.

#### Testing local changes with acceptance tests
As of right now, it's not easy to test your local code changes with acceptance tests.
Until [#1158](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/1158) is resolved you must:

1. Manually build and push the `wego-app` docker image to your own registry. Example:
`docker build -f Dockerfile -t aclevernameww/wego-app:latest . && docker push aclevernameww/wego-app:latest`
2. Update the `manifests/wego-app/deployment.yaml.tpl` to use your registry. Example:
`image: aclevernameww/wego-app:{{.Version}})`
3. Rebuild the local gitops binary via `make gitops`
4. Ensure `WEGO_BIN_PATH` is set to the local binary and `IS_TEST_ENV=true`

As a result, when the acceptance tests run `gitops install`, they should deploy your custom-built docker image with the desired code changes.
