# Installation

## Pre-requisites

### Kubernetes Cluster
Weave GitOps is compatible with conformant Kubernetes distributions which match the minimum required version level of [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#prerequisites).

### CLI
The `gitops` command-line interface is currently supported on Mac (x86 and Arm), and Linux including WSL.

Windows support is a [planned enhancement](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/663).

### Git Providers
Weave GitOps currently supports SaaS versions of GitHub and GitLab.

sudo mv /tmp/gitops /usr/local/bin
